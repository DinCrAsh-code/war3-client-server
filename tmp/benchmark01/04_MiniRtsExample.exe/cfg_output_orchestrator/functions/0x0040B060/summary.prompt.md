# Function summary: sub_40B060 (0x0040B060)

You are an expert reverse engineer analyzing one function of a stripped Windows binary (no symbols, no debug info). Names like `sub_00401000` are auto-generated placeholders; any other name (an export, an import thunk like `j_malloc`, a library function the disassembler recognized) is real and can be trusted. A name in square brackets, e.g. `sub_00401596 [PushFront]`, is a name suggested by an earlier step of this same analysis - informed, but not ground truth.

This is 32-bit x86 code from an optimizing compiler (possibly MSVC with whole-program optimization, /GL + /LTCG). Besides __cdecl, __stdcall, __thiscall (`this` in ecx) and __fastcall, non-exported functions may use custom register-based conventions - infer parameters from which registers and stack slots are read before being written, and note that floating-point values come back in st(0).

The call graph rooted at _main (0x00401050) is being analyzed bottom-up. This function calls no other function, so its behavior is entirely in the disassembly below. Every function that calls this one has described, from its own side, what it uses this function for ("How callers use this function"). Use all of that as context, but the disassembly is the ground truth: where the context and the code disagree, trust the code and say so.

## Binary

04_MiniRtsExample.exe - x86, 32-bit Windows PE EXE, image base 0x00400000, entry point 0x00419CD1

## Function

- Address: 0x0040B060
- Name: sub_40B060 (auto-generated placeholder)
- Size: 42 bytes, 12 instructions
- One call chain from the analysis root down to it: _main -> sub_401750 -> sub_40A0D0 -> sub_409940 -> sub_40B060

## How callers use this function

### From sub_409940 (0x00409940) - call at 0x00409ECA; vtable entry: slot 27 of vtable 0x0041D228, vtable used at 0x00409EAC

What that caller does overall (preliminary): Interprets and executes bytecode/script stream instructions from a resource structure (ESI), dispatching based on opcode bytes using a large switch/dispatch table and invoking specialized helper routines or recursive sub-executions.

Retrieved from slot 27 of vtable 0x0041D228 and called via a dynamic dispatch table with four arguments (this pointer in ESI, fetched operand pointers, count, and status output) to execute a specific virtual opcode handler.

Reference kinds used above:
- *vtable entry*: the function is an entry of a vtable whose address is used there - e.g. a constructor installing the vtable - so it may later be called virtually through it, but isn't called directly there.

## Disassembly

Comments after `; ->` say what an operand address points at.

```asm
0x0040B060  sub esp, 8
0x0040B063  mov eax, dword_42AC60                        ; -> 0x0042AC60 in .data
0x0040B068  fld
0x0040B06E  mov eax, [esp+8+arg_C]
0x0040B072  fstp
0x0040B076  mov edx, [esp+8+var_4]
0x0040B07A  mov byte ptr [esp+8+var_8], 2
0x0040B07E  mov ecx, [esp+8+var_8]
0x0040B081  mov [eax], ecx
0x0040B083  mov [eax+4], edx
0x0040B086  add esp, 8
